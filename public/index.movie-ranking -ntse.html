 <h1>The Best Movies According To Marcel</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Naruto</h3>
 <p>My best anime so far. It talks about a boy with limited shenobi skills, but he is so determined to be the greatest shenobi of all times Called the Hokage. It is a really cool story of what determination can do.</p>

 <h3>Alchemy of Souls</h3>
 <p>Really cool K-Series about alchemy and true love. It explains that you will feel the presence of your true love even if they take up a different body. Amazing drama on Netflix rated 8/10.</p>

 <h3>Itaewon Class</h3>

 <p>One of the greatest K-series drama of all time. In fact, if you are into a start up business, and with many challenges; i will recommend you watch this drama series. </p>
